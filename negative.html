  <h2>Healthy ways to express Negativity</h2>
  <h3>Everyone has to work through their negativity in different ways. <br> Look through the suggestions and find what works best for you</h3>
  <ul class="emotion">
    <li>If you feel out of control, walk away from the situation temporarily, until you cool down.</li>
    <li>Recognise and accept th emotion as a normal part of life.</li>
    <li>Talk to someone you trust about why you are feeling negative</li>
    <li>Once you have identified the problem, consider different solutions to the problem.</li>
    <li>Choose a physical activity to do such as running, swimming, exercising, playing a sport.</li>
    <li>Think before you speak.</li>
    <li>Stick with "I" statements (I am feeling.., I am feeling negatice because.., I want to try..).</li>
    <li>Write down why you are feeling negative (when you are finished, crumple it up and throw it away).</li>
    <li>Embrace confrontation. Try to understand what the other person is saying, take your time to think about it before you respond. </li>
    <li>Sometimes, not saying anything is the best solution. Just listen and come back later to talk about the situation over. Breathe.</li>
